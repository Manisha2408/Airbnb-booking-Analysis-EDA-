# Airbnb-booking-Analysis-EDA- 
I chose this project to understand the trends of Airbnb in New York City area and analysis is done through addressing the following questions:
 What can we learn about different hosts and areas?* What can we learn from predictions? (ex: locations, prices, reviews, etc)
 Which hosts are the busiest and why?
 Is there any noticeable difference of traffic among different areas and what could be the reason for it? 
 Which is the expensive location in dataset?
 What are the different room types available?
 How room types are distributed at different locations?
